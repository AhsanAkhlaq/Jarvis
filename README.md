# JARVIS: A Fun AI Adventure 🚀

**Created by Muhammad Ahsan in 2018** 🎉

JARVIS is a simple, rule-based AI system that controls your entire PC using **speech recognition**. Inspired by the iconic *Iron Man* AI from Marvel's cinematic universe, this project was my first step into the world of AI and remains a precious creation! 😊

## Features 🛠️
JARVIS is packed with awesome features to make your PC experience interactive:
- 📧 **Emailing**: Send emails with voice commands.
- 🌐 **Web Searching**: Search the web hands-free.
- 💬 **WhatsApp**: Message friends effortlessly.
- 🎵 **Media Playback**: Play movies, songs, or set alarms.
- 🖥️ **App Control**: Open any app with a simple command.
- And much more! If it’s on your PC, JARVIS can automate it! 😎

## Highlights ✨
Here are some of my favorite parts of the project:

1. **Continuous Integration** 🛠️  
   Python can be slow, so I added a module to bundle all files into a single `.exe` for faster execution. Project files are separate from the executable, so you can modify them without stopping the program! 🚄

2. **Self-Updating** 🔄  
   Just say, *"JARVIS, update yourself!"* and *BOOM*—it updates automatically. No fuss, no stress! 💥

3. **Self-Hacking** 😈  
   For a bit of fun, say *"Hack"* and JARVIS will playfully crash your PC (don’t worry, it’s safe and requires a password)! 🔒

4. **Rotation** 🎢  
   Say *"Rotate 100 times"* and your PC’s display will spin like it’s on an amusement park ride. It’s harmless and super fun—try it! 😄

5. **And More!** 🎉  
   From launching apps to playing media, setting alarms, and automating *everything* on your PC, JARVIS is your tech sidekick.

## Inspiration 💡
In 2018, I watched *Iron Man* and was amazed by Tony Stark’s AI, JARVIS. That sparked my passion for coding, and I set out to build my own version. This project was my first dive into AI, making it a nostalgic and cherished milestone. 🌟

## About the Creator 👨‍💻
Hi, I'm Muhammad Ahsan! I built JARVIS in 2018 as a fun project to explore AI and automation. This was my first step into the world of artificial intelligence, and I hope you enjoy playing with it as much as I enjoyed creating it! 😊
